## Poderman Challenge

An application used to complete data form visit based on user preference, built with React, JavaScript, and Chakra UI (CSS).

This project is currently in development. Users can complete the differents forms adding photos and descrictions to complete the visit.

## Reflection things i think i could do better

  -  Creating more error handlers and input validations
  -  Adding a pagination in the Admin dashboard to make it more efficient if the project gets bigger
  - Adding unit testing with Jest
